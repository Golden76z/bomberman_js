# BOMBERMAN Javascript

![Bomberman Game](./images/background_forest.gif)

A classic Bomberman-style game built with vanilla JavaScript and DOM manipulation. This project demonstrates high-performance browser game development without frameworks or Canvas.

## üéÆ Game Overview

Bomberman is a strategic maze-based action game where players navigate through a grid-based level, placing bombs to destroy obstacles and defeat enemies. The goal is to clear paths, find power-ups, and ultimately reach the exit to advance to the next level.

### Key Features

- **Smooth 60+ FPS Gameplay**: Optimized for high performance with no frame drops
- **Keyboard Controls**: Responsive and fluid character movement
- **Pause Menu**: Includes continue and restart functionality
- **Scoreboard**: Displays countdown timer, score, and lives
- **DOM-based Rendering**: Efficient use of HTML elements instead of Canvas

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Performance Optimization

This game is built with performance as a priority, implementing:

- **RequestAnimationFrame**: For smooth animation loops synchronized with the browser's refresh rate
- **Layer Management**: Strategic DOM layering to minimize repaints
- **Transform & Opacity**: CSS properties that trigger only compositing instead of full repaints
- **Task Scheduling**: Optimized JavaScript execution to prevent jank

### Architecture

- **Object-Oriented Design**: Modular code structure following OOP principles
- **Event System**: Clean handling of user input and game events
- **State Management**: Proper game state tracking and transitions
- **Collision Detection**: Efficient algorithms for interaction between game elements

## üéØ How to Play

1. Use **WASD** or **Arrow Keys** to move your character
2. Press **Space** to place bombs
3. Press **P** to pause the game
4. Destroy blocks to clear paths and find power-ups
5. Avoid enemies and your own bomb blasts!
6. Find the exit to progress to the next level

### Controls

| Z / ‚Üë | Move Up |
| Q / ‚Üê | Move Left |
| S / ‚Üì | Move Down |
| D / ‚Üí | Move Right |
